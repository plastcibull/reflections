How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helped detecting all the changes that's been made on the previous version of the file,
    and therefore detecting areas of the code where things might have gone wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  saving commits manually have a pro that as a human we can make a judgement call whether the change
  been made is worth to create a new commit for, on the other side it's nearly impossible for the machine
  to make such a decision, the con of it is clearly that one should never forget to make the commit when necessary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because the files in web development projects are generally linked and connected logically to each other,
    html, css, javascript, etc. for example changing the name of the function in a javascript file require us to change
    edit that function's call on an event handler.
