1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When we initialize a repository we can start making commits, we need to do it because we must
  tell Git that we want to initalize a git repo in that directory.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
 Staging area is different from working directory in two aspects:
 1. in case if we want to commit the changes in some files but not all of them.
 2. in case we want to bundle the changes of multiple files in a single commit.
